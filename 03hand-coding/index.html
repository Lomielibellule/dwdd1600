        <h1>Who is Salomé Passeraub?</h1>
        <h2>When did she start?</h2>
        <p>I started playing the Cello when I was <Strong>five</Strong>. At first I wanted to play the violin, but my mom thought it was better for me to play the cello. So this is what I did. After 18 years of playing, including a two year break, I finally started my journey as a Cello performance student at UVU.</p>
        <h2>About orchestras</h2>
        <p>The first orchestra I was a part of was the ouroboros ensemble in Frigourg, Switzerland. The goal of this orchestra was to play music that was less popular. The concert I enjoyed the most was about spanish composer, requiring us to adapt our mindset on rhythm and polyphony. A few year after that, I moved to Utah, where I joined for a few semester the BYU symphony orchestra. This was a nice experience, I mostly liked praying before every rehearsal, I always thought it was making us more ready to play and learn new things.</p>
        <p>Finally, I have been in the UVU symphony orcherstra with Dr. Chau for the past two semester. Though the spiritual side of the music is less present, I have learned a lot with our orchestra conductor. His teachings are wise and they have really helped me deal with anxiety.</p>
        <h2>My current job</h2>
        <p>Next to my education, I teach the cello at <em>Best in Music</em> in Orem. Here is what I like about it.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>I enjoy spending time with my students. They teaching me so much by being students. This way, I learn more about how I can help them better.</li>
            <li>I can receive great discounts on music and instrument because I work right next to a music store</li>
            <li>Teaching has helped me improved my aural skill.</li>
            <li>I enjoy seeing people improve.</li>
        </ol>
